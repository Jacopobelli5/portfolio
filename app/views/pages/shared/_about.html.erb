  <div class="col-6 about-text">
  <p>My name is Jacopo, I am Italian and I am based in London since 2018.
  </p>
  <p>For the past few years in the English capital I have been working in the customer service industry. Later I have decided to do what I have always liked, codes 👨🏻‍💻.
  After attending and completing a coding bootcamp I finally feel ready to start my career as a web developer, so I am currently looking to get a junior/entry level developer job.
  </p>
  <p>As a real Italian guy I really love food, either I have to eat it or cook it (or both). I am also a guitar player 🎸 and on my free time I like to play a few songs from my favourite artists!.
  I am also a big football fan but I won't share the club I support, just in case...
